# personal-monorepo

A centralized monorepo for storing and organizing all my development setup scripts, AI agent prompts, templates, configurations, and utilities.

## 📋 Purpose

This repository serves as a single source of truth for:
- **Setup Scripts**: Automated environment configuration and installation scripts for consistent development environments
- **Agent Prompts**: Curated prompts and system messages for AI agents and LLMs
- **Templates**: Boilerplate code, project templates, and scaffolding structures
- **Configurations**: Development tools configurations, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure-as-code
- **Utilities**: Shared scripts, helpers, and reusable tools across multiple projects
